        Welcome to SAGE\â€™s own Carbon Footprint Tracker. We\'re dedicated to giving you the
        very best experience, with a focus on helping our employees reducing their carbon
        footprint.\n\n
        Founded in 2020 by Group 19, SAGE has come a long way from its humble beginnings in
        a rural Newcastle upon Tyne where Alan Rickman first started out. His passion
        for helping other people be more eco-friendly drove him to build an app to aid those
        in his workplace and gave him the impetus to turn hard work and inspiration into to a
        booming app. We now serve customers all Newcastle upon Tyne and are thrilled to be a
        part of the eco-friendly wing of the IT industry.\n\n

        We hope you enjoy our products as much as we enjoy offering them to you.
        If you have any questions or comments, please don\'t hesitate to contact us.\n\n
        Sincerely,\n
        Alan Rickman, CEO, Founder, Prodigy, Wizard.
